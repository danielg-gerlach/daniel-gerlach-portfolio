          <p>
            I'm a Business Informatics student specializing in Data Engineering, passionate about 
            building robust, scalable data infrastructure that powers intelligent decision-making.
          </p>
          <p>
            My expertise spans the entire data lifecycle - from ingesting and processing terabytes 
            of raw data to building machine learning pipelines that deliver real-time insights. 
            I thrive on solving complex distributed systems challenges and optimizing data architectures 
            for performance and reliability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently focused on real-time stream processing, cloud-native data platforms, and 
            MLOps practices. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and building systems 
            that scale gracefully with business needs.
